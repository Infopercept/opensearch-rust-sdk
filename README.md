**A high-performance OpenSearch Extension SDK for Rust**

Build secure, scalable OpenSearch extensions with the safety and performance of Rust.

## About Infopercept

[Infopercept](https://www.infopercept.com) is a leading cybersecurity company providing comprehensive security solutions globally. As part of our commitment to the open-source community and secure software development, we're contributing the OpenSearch Rust SDK to enable developers to build robust extensions for OpenSearch using Rust's memory safety and performance advantages.

## Overview

The OpenSearch Rust SDK provides a comprehensive framework for building OpenSearch extensions that:
- Run as separate processes for better isolation and security
- Communicate via high-performance binary transport protocol
- Leverage Rust's memory safety guarantees
- Support async/await patterns for efficient I/O operations

## Features

- **Memory Safe**: Leverages Rust's ownership system to prevent common security vulnerabilities
- **High Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and efficient async I/O with Tokio
- **Process Isolation**: Extensions run separately, preventing cluster-wide failures
- **Binary Protocol**: Efficient transport layer communication with OpenSearch
- **Type Safe**: Strong typing catches errors at compile time
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with trait-based architecture

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or higher
- OpenSearch 3.0+ with extensions enabled
- Docker (optional, for running OpenSearch)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Infopercept/opensearch-rust-sdk.git
cd opensearch-rust-sdk

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Running the Example Extension

1. **Start OpenSearch with extensions enabled:**

```bash
# Using Docker Compose
just start-cluster

# Or manually
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9600:9600 \
  -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
  -e "OPENSEARCH_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourPassword123!" \
  -e "OPENSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Dopensearch.experimental.feature.extensions.enabled=true" \
  opensearchproject/opensearch:latest
```

2. **Run the example extension:**

```bash
cargo run --example hello-world
```

3. **Register the extension:**

```bash
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/_extensions/initialize" \
  -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
  -u admin:YourPassword123! \
  --data @examples/hello/hello.json
```

4. **Test the extension:**

```bash
curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/_extensions/_hello-world-rs/hello" \
  -u admin:YourPassword123!
```

## Architecture

The SDK follows a modular architecture designed for extensibility:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "OpenSearch Cluster"
        OS[OpenSearch Node]
        EM[Extensions Manager]
    end
    
    subgraph "Extension Process"
        ER[Extension Runner]
        EXT[Extension Implementation]
        TP[Transport Protocol]
        RH[REST Handlers]
    end
    
    OS <--> EM
    EM <--> ER
    ER --> EXT
    EXT --> TP
    EXT --> RH

```

## Development

### Building Your First Extension

```rust
use opensearch_sdk::prelude::*;

#[derive(Default)]
struct MyExtension;

#[async_trait]
impl Extension for MyExtension {
    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "my-extension"
    }
    
    fn unique_id(&self) -> &str {
        "my-extension-rs"
    }
    
    async fn initialize(&mut self, context: ExtensionContext) -> Result<(), ExtensionError> {
        println!("Extension initialized!");
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let extension = MyExtension::default();
    ExtensionRunner::run(extension).await
}
```
