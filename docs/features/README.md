# OpenSearch Rust SDK Feature Implementation Plan

This directory contains detailed feature specifications and implementation plans for bringing the OpenSearch SDK to Rust. The features are based on analysis of both the [Java SDK](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-sdk-java) and [Python SDK](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-sdk-py).

## Feature Categories

### Core Features (Priority: High)
1. [Core Extension Framework](01-core-extension-framework.md) - Foundation for all extensions
2. [Transport Protocol](02-transport-protocol.md) - Binary communication with OpenSearch
3. [REST API Framework](03-rest-api-framework.md) - HTTP endpoint support
4. [Settings Management](04-settings-management.md) - Type-safe configuration

### Extension System (Priority: Medium)
5. [Action System](05-action-system.md) - Request/response handling
6. [Search Extensions](06-search-extensions.md) - Queries, aggregations, scoring
7. [Analysis Extensions](07-analysis-extensions.md) - Tokenizers, analyzers, filters
8. [Script Extensions](08-script-extensions.md) - Custom scripting support

### Advanced Features (Priority: Medium-Low)
9. [Ingest Extensions](09-ingest-extensions.md) - Data processing pipelines
10. [Mapper Extensions](10-mapper-extensions.md) - Custom field types
11. [Discovery & Clustering](11-discovery-clustering.md) - Node and service discovery
12. [Security Integration](12-security-integration.md) - Authentication and authorization

### Infrastructure (Priority: Low)
13. [Client Libraries](13-client-libraries.md) - Rust client for OpenSearch
14. [Testing Framework](14-testing-framework.md) - Extension testing utilities
15. [Migration Tools](15-migration-tools.md) - Plugin to extension migration

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current Status: In Progress)
- ✅ Basic transport protocol (Hello World)
- ⬜ Complete extension framework
- ⬜ Full transport protocol implementation
- ⬜ Basic REST handler support

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- ⬜ Settings management system
- ⬜ Action system with async support
- ⬜ REST API registration and routing
- ⬜ Basic client support

### Phase 3: Extension Points
- ⬜ Search extension support
- ⬜ Analysis extension support
- ⬜ Script extension support
- ⬜ Ingest processor support

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- ⬜ Mapper extensions
- ⬜ Extension-to-extension communication
- ⬜ Security integration
- ⬜ Performance optimizations

## Design Principles

1. **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's ownership system for safe concurrency
2. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with compile-time guarantees
3. **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and efficient async runtime
4. **Ergonomics**: Intuitive APIs following Rust idioms
5. **Compatibility**: Maintain protocol compatibility with Java/Python SDKs
